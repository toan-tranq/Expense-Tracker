## 📖 What I Learned
Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of:
1. **Array Methods:** Using `filter()`, `map()`, and `reduce()` to process financial data.
2. **Event Handling:** Managing user interactions such as form submissions and click events.
3. **Storage:** Implementing `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()` to store objects in the browser's memory.
4. **Clean Code:** Organizing JavaScript into functional modules for better readability.
